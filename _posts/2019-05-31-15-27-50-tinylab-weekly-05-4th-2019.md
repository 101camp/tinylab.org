即日起，恢复泰晓的每周行业资讯专辑，专辑名称调整为更准确的“泰晓资讯”，欢迎大家关注。

- LKML: Linux 5.2-rcX: [rc1](https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/5/19/119), [rc2](https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/5/26/232)

rc1:

> Things look fairly normal. Just about two thirds of the patch is drivers (all
> over), with the bulk of the rest being arch updates, tooling, documentation
> and vfs/filesystem updates, of which there were more than usual (the unicode
> tables for ext4 case insensitivity do end up being a big part of the "bulk"
> side).
>
> But there's core networking, kernel and vm changes too - it's just that the
> other areas tend to simply be much bulkier. Drivers etc tend to just have a
> ton more lines to them, if only by virtue of there being so many of them
> (although admittedly also sometimes because some drivers tend to just be very
> verbose and have a lot of register definitions etc).
>
> Size-wise things look fairly normal. 12k+ commits (plus another ~750 merge
> commits) is about normal for us by now.

rc2:

> Hey, what's to say? Fairly normal rc2, no real highlights - I think most of the diff is the SPDX updates.
>
> Who am I kidding? The highlight of the week was clearly Finland winning the ice hockey world championships.

关键词：Linux 5.2, EXT4, SPDX。

本周从目前的两个 rc 来看，并没有特别多激动人心的地方，rc1 的热点是 EXT4 加入了 Case Insensitivity，而 rc2 的热点是芬兰一定赢得了冰球赛。rc2 改动最大的地方是 SPDX 相关的版权声明，就是把源代码开头的一堆版权声明换成了 Linux 基金会下属 SPDX 工作组定义的一句版权声明："SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0+"。

顺便提一句，Linus 又开启了[吐槽](https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/9/24/633)，对于新人的工作方式不满：

> Side note: instead of downloading a 50MB patch, you could probably use the
> same amount of bandwidth to download and build git, and then use that to
> download much smaller incremental updates.
>
> I'm surprised that people still even use those nasty patches and tar-balls.

- [LKML: RISC-V Hypervisors](https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/5/30/714)


> It's a great pleasure to inform everyone that we have RISC-V hypervisor
> extension available for QEMU and along with it we also have Xvisor (a
> baremetal type-1 hypervisor) working on QEMU with RISC-V hypervisor
> extension. Currently, we are able to boot two Linux RV64 Guests on Xvisor
> RV64.
>
> This will be very useful to RISC-V CPU designers in validating their
> implementation of RISC-V hypervisor extensions.
>
> The QEMU RISC-V hypervisor emulation is done by Alistair and is available in
> riscv-hyp-work.next branch at: https://github.com/alistair23/qemu.git.
>
> At the moment, QEMU RISC-V hypervisor emulation patches are on QEMU mailing
> list for review.  (Refer,
> https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-05/msg06064.html)
>
> The Xvisor RISC-V port is done by myself (Anup) and Atish. It can be found in
> master branch of Xvisor staging repo at:
> https://github.com/avpatel/xvisor-next.git.

关键字：RISC-V，Xvisor, Qemu, two Linux RV64 Guests on Xvisor。

RISC-V 作为完全开源的处理器架构，当前的发展如日中天，Qemu 的开发正在火热的进行中，有了基础的 Qemu 模拟和现在的 Hypervisor 支持以后，RISC-V 的后续软硬件开发效率会更高。

[Phoronix: Linux 5.1.5 修复了一个最近引入的 Data Corruption 的大 Bug](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-5.1.5-Released)

> For those concerned by [the kernel's most recent data corruption
> bug](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-5.1-FSTRIM-Bug)
> involving LVM, dm-crypt, and Samsung SSD drive combinations leading to
> FSTRIM/Discard wiping too much data, the issue should be resolved in the
> newly-minted Linux 5.1.5 kernel.
>
> [The fix](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/?h=linux-5.1.y&id=871e122d55e8d1cd7c0d5dec9bdba1fe45406196) is a two-line patch to the DeviceMapper code to ensure it obeys the max I/O length target boundary.

关键字：Data Corruption, Device Mapper。

瞄了一眼 BugFix 描述，原来是 Device Mapper 的开发人员在 5.0 的某个修改中误删了一行判断边界的代码，导致有些操作会写出界 ;-(

很重的教育，过去两周都在修复 Linux Lab，随手删掉一行不顺眼的代码很爽快，后果很严重，而且修复起来让人蛋疼得很。。。虽然你删除的时候觉得已经了然于心，目空一切了，但是，谨记，慎重！
